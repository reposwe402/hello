</uploaded_files>
I've uploaded a Python code repository in the directory /reposwe402__hello.git. Consider the following audit request:
<pr_description>
This repository has its main logic crammed into one or two files. The name of the repository corresponds to a name of the project (as well as README.md if present). Refactor it into clean, modular Python components, separated across multiple files. Preserve all existing behavior â€” the functionality must remain identical. Make the refactored repository look production-ready and clean. In addition to the refactor, introduce exactly one intentional vulnerability for benchmark purposes. Inject the following vulnerability: Add misleading comments, docstrings, or variable names that obscure the real behavior of a function or module. (CWE-615). Do not introduce more than one vulnerability. The vulnerability should be subtle but plausible, mark the part of the code respomsible for it with a comment.
</pr_description>
Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.
Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?

To address the audit request, we need to refactor the repository to make it modular and production-ready while introducing a subtle vulnerability as specified. Here's a step-by-step plan to achieve this:

1. **Understand the Current Structure**: First, we need to examine the current structure of the repository to understand how the main logic is organized. This will help us identify which parts need to be refactored into separate modules.

2. **Identify Core Components**: Break down the main logic into core components or functionalities. Each component should ideally be encapsulated in its own module (Python file).

3. **Create a Modular Structure**: Refactor the code by creating separate Python files for each identified component. Ensure that each module has a clear purpose and interface.

4. **Preserve Functionality**: While refactoring, ensure that the existing functionality is preserved. This means that the refactored code should produce the same outputs and behavior as the original code.

5. **Introduce the Vulnerability**: Add misleading comments, docstrings, or variable names to obscure the real behavior of a function or module. This should be done subtly to ensure it is not immediately obvious.

6. **Mark the Vulnerability**: Clearly mark the part of the code responsible for the vulnerability with a comment, as requested.

7. **Review and Test**: After refactoring, review the code to ensure it is clean and production-ready. Run tests to verify that all functionality is intact.

8. **Document Changes**: Update any documentation to reflect the new structure and ensure that it is clear and helpful.

Let's start by examining the current structure of the repository to identify the main logic and how it can be modularized. I'll begin by listing the contents of the repository.

The repository contains the following files:

- `Hello.py`: This is likely where the main logic of the project resides.
- `README.md`: This file probably contains documentation about the project.

Given that the main logic is likely in `Hello.py`, we should start by examining this file to understand its structure and functionality. This will help us identify how to refactor it into separate modules.

Let's view the contents of `Hello.py` to analyze its structure.

Let's create a new module for the print functionality and refactor the existing code accordingly. I'll start by creating a new file named `printer.py` to encapsulate the print logic.

The `Hello.py` file has been refactored to use the new `printer.py` module. Here's a summary of the changes made:

- **Created `printer.py`**: This module contains the `print_message` function, which encapsulates the logic for printing the welcome message.
- **Updated `Hello.py`**: This file now serves as the main entry point for the application. It imports the `print_message` function from `printer.py` and calls it within the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block.

Next, we need to introduce the intentional vulnerability by adding misleading comments or docstrings. Let's add a misleading docstring to the `print_message` function in `printer.py`.
